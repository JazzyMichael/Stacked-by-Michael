            The official StackAI platform uses this page to manage third-party
            connections with other services, however that&apos;s a bit
            unnecessary for this project so I&apos;ll share some cat pictures
            instead! (All of the desk pictures were taken as I was building
            this).

            I adopted this beauty when I began my career as a software engineer
            in 2018 making touch-screen kiosk apps for an early stage startup.
            Her name is <span className="font-medium">Jazzy</span> and I
            absolutely love it. Jazz is about understanding all the factors at
            play and deliberately breaking the common structures of music theory
            to explore sounds and experiences based on curiosity; I use this as
            a metaphor for my approach to life, as I strongly value curiousity
            and integrity and taking risks. I will risk sounding awful for the
            potential to sound incredible.
